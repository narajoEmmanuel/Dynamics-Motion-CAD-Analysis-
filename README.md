# Dynamics Project - Rigid Body Analysis

## Overview

This project, conducted at the Technological University of Costa Rica, focuses on the practical verification of a proposed exercise in the Dynamics course. 

The aim is to corroborate theoretical results using various validation methods, incorporating dynamic analysis through SolidWorks software. The project involves simulations in SolidWorks and SolidWorks Motion, manual calculations presented in the calculation report, and a comprehensive comparison of theoretical and simulated results in the written report.

## Project Report

The project provides a practical validation of theoretical concepts in Dynamics, demonstrating the application of kinematic and kinetic principles using both manual calculations and SolidWorks simulations. The detailed analysis in the report ensures a comprehensive understanding of the rigid body's behavior in motion.
